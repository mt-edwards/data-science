# Data Science

## Data Engineering

Data Science and Data Engineering different:

- **Data Engineering**: data storage, access and compute.
- **Data Science**: data exploration and induction.

Data Science is similar to **Statistics**

## Data

Types of data:

- **Tabular**
- Text (Natural Language Processing)
- Images (Computer Vision)

## Projects

Types projects:

- **Supervised Learning** (predict output)
- Unsupervised Learning 
- Semi-supervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning (e.g. AI and Robotics)

Types of supervised learning:

- **Classification** (nominal output)
- Regression (numeric output)

## Stages

Data Science stages for a supervised learning project:

- Data Tidying
- Data Splitting
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Preprocessing
- Model Building
- Model Evaluation
 
These stages are **iterated** (not numbered).

# Data Tidying

## Data Tidying

Obtain [tidy data form](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf):

1. Each variable forms a column.
2. Each observation forms a row.

This form is required for most data science tools. One of these variables is the *output* (to be predicted) and the others are *predictors*.

# Data Splitting

## Data Splitting

Obtain two data sets:

1. **Training set**: this data set is used to build the model
2. **Test set**: this data set is used to evaluate the model

The test set is *only* used at the end of the project. The training set is also used for exploratory data analysis.

# Exploratory Data Analysis

## Overview

Exploratory Data Analysis is all about distributions. A distribution describes the variation within and between variables.

Types of distribution:

- predictor and output distributions
- predictor-output distributions
- predictor-predictor distributions

This stage affects data preprocessing and model building.

## Predictor Distributions

Numeric:

- Centre (e.g. mean)
- Spread (e.g. variance)
- Skewness
- Outliers

Nominal:

- Number of levels
- Sparsity
- Balance

## Predictor-output Distributions

Types of relationship:

- Weak or Strong
- Linear or Non-linear

# Data Preprocessing

## Data Preprocessing

Data Preprocessing is about transforming the data so that a model can processes it. EDA motivates variable transformations

Univariate Transformations: 

- **Log**: remove skewness
- **Normalise**: centre and scale

# Model Building

## Model Building

Popular classification models include:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine
- k-Nearest Neighbours

# Model Evaluation

## Model Evaluation

At this stage the model is evaluated for it's performance. 

Classification evaluation metrics:

- Accuracy: percent of correct predictions
- Sensitivity: percent of correct positive predictions
- Specificity: percent of correct negative predictions
- Cost / Benefit measures: derived from Sensitivity and Specificity
